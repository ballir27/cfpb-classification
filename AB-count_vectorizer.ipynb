    "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau publishes the Consumer Complaint Database, a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that were sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with a dataset of over 350,000 such complaints for 5 common issue types. Your goal is to train a text classification model to identify the issue type based on the consumer complaint narrative. The data can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hz1gnCCr-SDGjnKgcPbg7Nd3NztOLdxw/view?usp=share_link\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the project, your team should should prepare a short presentation where you talk about the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What steps did you take to preprocess the data?\n",
    "* How did a model using unigrams compare to one using bigrams or trigrams?\n",
    "* How did a count vectorizer compare to a tfidf vectorizer?\n",
    "* What models did you try and how successful were they? Where did they struggle? Were there issues that the models commonly mixed up?\n",
    "* What words or phrases were most influential on your models' predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: A larger dataset containing 20 additional categories can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gW6LScUL-Z7mH6gUZn-1aNzm4p4CvtpL/view?usp=share_link. How well do your models work with these additional categories?"

That was complete and sent the following morning. \n",

      "I am writing to dispute the following information in my file. \n",
      "The late fees on this report as of XX/XX/XXXX are inaccurate because of the following reason ( s ) : Around XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage company was bought out by another. Formerly OCWEN loan services, it is now named PHH Mortgage. During that time, I was on a modification plan that finally allowed me to get on track after my divorce which I was current on. After the merge, I found myself unemployed due to the decision to homeschool my kids and several incidents with a daycare provider resulting in multiple doctor visits due to infections. My XXXX  payment cleared the bank the day before my final paycheck hit and the new mortgage company ( PHH mortgage ) immediately canceled the modification and issued a statement for the full payment due immediately. After several attempts trying to reach someone to rectify the loan got more and more behind. I tried logging into my account to make payments, but the system was down. I was told that they were still transitioning files and that I needed to reapply for a modification In the meantime, but not until they mailed me documents to do so which took almost a month. I was also behind on homeowners dues and had been since my divorce and the HOA was no longer willing to make arrangements that would work for my budget. Though the homeowners association agreed to allow me to set up a payment plan, it was with an unrealistic down payment of {$2500.00}. Since I didn't have it, the property was placed in an auction on XX/XX/XXXX. Two weeks later I received a letter and check in the mail stating someone purchased my home at auction and the check was the difference from the sale. \n",
      "I took the money and moved my kids to a better school district and we became apartment renters for the first time in our lives on XX/XX/XXXX. Months went by and I received a call from the investor who purchased my property ( XXXX XXXX ). He stated that he needed to get the mortgage loan information to pick up the loan payments because there is another lien on the home. I was completely confused and asked him, \" didn't you purchase the property in full? '' The letter I received from the HOA attorney said that the purchase included all outstanding liens, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did some research, had him added as a third party to take over the loan and now we are here. When he found out how much the mortgage company was asking him to pay he was no longer interested in keeping the property and apparently all that was paid at auction was the outstanding HOA debt. Not knowing my options at this point, I contacted the mortgage company and asked to get more information on a short-sale because I assumed that was my only option. They responded and gave me instructions to wait on the application in the mail and to get with a realtor for short-sale papers. I reached out to my realtor and she said she would make some calls to her investor friends to see if they are interested in the property. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested to begin the process of a short-sale on my property. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email that confirmed that I had requested a Mortgage Assistance application to be mailed to me. I was not given an option on the method of delivery and was told that I would need to allow sufficient time for mailing and that a realtor would have to assist me with this process. I let me broker/realtor know and we awaited the documents. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to the relationship manager stating that I never received the documents and that they needed to send them to me via email immediately to avoid the upcoming foreclosure sale date that had been set for XX/XX/XXXX. I received a response back on XX/XX/XXXX, that stated that they apologized for the inconvenience and emailed the documents to me also stating that they no longer had a sufficient amount of time to review the account for a short-sale. I immediately forwarded this to my realtor who stated she was going to call them and asked me to complete a 3rd party authorization so she could speak to them on my behalf. After gathering all the necessary sale documents, my realtor sent them to all 3 of the company 's email addresses along with the 3rd party authorization on XX/XX/XXXX. We already had a buyer in place and a current payoff amount to move forward. On XX/XX/XXXX, my realtor called to follow-up on the status of the short-sale request and was not able to speak to anyone because they stated she was not authorized. She contacted me and when I called they stated that the signature on the 3rd party authorization was not legible. Everything written was written in the same ink with the same pen. On the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I emailed a 4th request to have XXXX XXXX ( realtor ) added to my account to speak on my behalf. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me again frustrated because again they would not speak to her without \" authorization ''. By this time drawing out the length of the loan and allowing more time and interest to accumulate. She connected us on a 3-way call where I explained to the agent that she was allowed to speak on behalf of me. The agent stated that the account read that there was missing documentation in the mortgage assistance packet, and XXXX told her that the documents being requested had either been sent in or was awaiting an updated payoff because the previous one had expired. The agent stated that she would put in a request for another payoff quote. When I got home I received a letter requesting Articles of Association, settlement disclosure statement, and the co-borrower 's signature ( what the agent had stated on the call ). I also received an email requesting the same information on XX/XX/XXXX however, we still had not received a payoff quote and the one currently in place was set to expire on XX/XX/XXXX. I emailed this information to my realtor and she contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX ( today ). To her surprise they still would not speak to her and the agent on the phone would not disclose the information discussed with the previous agent. We tried to obtain information on where the short-sale was in process to-date and he stated that we were missing the same 3 items. We requested the payoff, had XXXX added as the point-of-contact and have a pending foreclosure date set for XX/XX/XXXX. This company has not been diligent in its communication and it has cost me thousands of dollars in interest and mortgage payments as I have not lived in this property since XXXX of XXXX. I have been trying to resolve this by having the gentleman who purchased my home in an HOA auction in XXXX of XXXX take over the mortgage, but they would not allow the deed to be transferred over without 1 year of on-time payments.\n",

Incorrect Loan Modification and the loss mitigation packet that was not required for COVID-19 impacted loans. I believe that the core issue with the reporting is the same issue we had with the servicer multiple times failure to treat the loan as a COVID-19 impacted loan in addition to data entry errors.\n",

      "COVID-19 Impacted Timeline In XX/XX/XXXX, I notified my mortgage servicer, RoundPoint, that my employer was going to be implementing pay cuts that may affect my ability to make timely payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was permanently laid off. I immediately contacted RoundPoint and was told I would qualify for a COVID-19 forbearance. Roundpoint informed me that XXXX payment would still be made as scheduled. XXXX payment was also auto withdrawn, though I was told that would not happen. \n",
      "On XX/XX/XXXX, a letter was sent outlining the COVID-19 forbearance terms. The first three bullet points are as follows : Payments are suspended for up to 6 months. \n",
      "Credit will report as current and active on the COVID-19 Forbearance Plan. \n",
      "The loan will report to the credit reporting companies as current and active on a forbearance plan. \n",
      "\n",
      "This letter outlined {$0.00} payments from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Round Point sent monthly emails asking if my income was still affected by COVID-19, which I answered in the affirmative. I was able to make full, timely payments through XX/XX/XXXX. \n",
      "\n",
      "In XX/XX/XXXX, I was called by the servicer to ask about my missed payment in XXXX. I informed them of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which they were able to access after around 10 minutes. \n",
      "\n",

      "This letter also outlined the {$0.00} payments due from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to the servicer to discuss next steps. At this time, I also added my wife as an authorized representative on the account. The servicer advised that a Mortgage Assistance Application needed to be filled out and submitted ( which I later found to be incorrect as I was affected by COVID-19 ). That was complete and sent the following morning. \n",
      "\n",
      "On XX/XX/XXXX, a letter was sent informing of an approval for a Flex Modification, however the terms were that of a normal modification rather than a Covid-19 Flex Modification ( interest rate at 4.125 % rather than 2.875 % ). My wife called immediately, and after explaining the error multiple times had the issue escalated to a supervisor. \n",
      "\n",
      "On XX/XX/XXXX, she was contacted by the servicer to inform us that there was indeed an error, and we would be receiving the Covid-19 Flex Modification details soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "On XX/XX/XXXX, a letter was sent outlining the terms of the COVID-19 flex modification. The trial period included three payments of {$1300.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. \n",
      "\n",
      "At some point during the Trial Period, a letter was sent from the servicer notifying me that the loan was delinquent and if I did not contact them the foreclosure process may start. I contacted them immediately, and they told me it was an error and to ignore the letter. \n",

      "Currently, the mortgage payments show as Unknown from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Current, paying or paid as agreed XX/XX/XXXX, Unknown XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Current, paying or paid as agreed XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. The remark on the account is Paying partial payment agreement, nothing seems to be coded as a COVID-19 agreement. \n",
      "\n",
      "On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX alerted me of a Major Derogatory from Roundpoint Mtg. It looks like your account with Roundpoint MTG received a major derogatory status. This usually means that no payments have been made to a past-due account for 120 days or longer. \n",
      "\n",
      "XXXX top-level breakdown is showing one account over 90 days delinquent, which is almost assuredly the mortgage. This mortgage is not nor has ever been considered delinquent, and every payment made since XX/XX/XXXX has been the exact amount listed on the billing statement. Further, my credit report shows that they were not, in fact, reporting the mortgage as current and active on a Covid-19 forbearance plan throughout the forbearance period. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I am requesting that the payment and delinquency history be modified to current, as set forth in the terms of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, and in compliance with the CARES Act. There should be no late or delinquent payments reported. The payment amount reported after the execution of the loan modification should be the amount that is listed on the billing statement. Paying under a partial or modified payment agreement should be removed, as this was a COVID-19 Loan Modification accommodation.\n",
